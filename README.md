<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The app is called Progress Tracker and its main functionality is to track how much time an user has spent on separate modules each day.
The requirements can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Final-Capstone-Project-Tracking-App-22e454da738c46efaf17721826841772) :point_left:

This is the workflow of the app:

- The user is required to register with name, email, password, total hours available for study (300, 270, 240) and how much overall time the user wants to save (i.e. 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%).

- Selected hours will be divided by numbers of days in a month to derive daily time available for study for each module, and the target saving time; which will be calculated against total progress to see if target is met.

- The user can log in by typing the mail and password.

- The user will be able to manually enter how much time he spent the day on different modules (HTML, CSS, Ruby, RoR, Javascript, and React).

- The user can then access the page with readings and check the total progress made within time.

- The user will see how much time is available to further assign in different modules.

- The user can create multiple entries and keep track of his study progress each day.
